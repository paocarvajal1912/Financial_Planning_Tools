# Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations

In this single notebook, we will show two financial analysis tools:

Part 1: A financial planner for emergencies. Investors will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. They will be able to determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Part 2: A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of a retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

We use the information from the Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio in your Jupyter notebook.

## Technologies

Libraries we use in the notebook are:
OS, Requests, Json, Pandas, Numpy, Dotenv, Alpaca_trade_api, MCForecastTools, Datetime and the pandas.tseries.offsets.
